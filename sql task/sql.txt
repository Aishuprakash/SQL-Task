1.What are scalar functions and write a query?

Scalar functions are the built-in functions in SQL, and whatever be the input provided to the 
scalar functions, the output returned by these functions will always be a single value.
UCASE()-SELECT UCASE ("Welcome to Javatpoint") AS UpperCase_String;  
LCASE()-SELECT LCASE ("WELCOME TO JAVATPOINT") AS LowerCase_String;
MID()-SELECT MID ("Welcome to the world of databases", 16, 18) AS Substring;  
LENGTH()-SELECT ID, LENGTH (Name) AS LengthOfName, Age, Address, Salary FROM customers;
ROUND()-SELECT ROUND (18000.44444, 2) AS RoundedValue;  
NOW()- SELECT NOW () AS CurrentDatenTime;  
FORMAT()-SELECT FORMAT (6789.6789, 2) AS Formatted_Number; 

2.Explains joins with example and output?

The SQL JOIN joins two tables based on a common column, and selects records that have matching values in these columns.

INNER JOIN (Same as JOIN)
The SQL INNER JOIN joins two tables based on a common column, and selects records that have matching values in these columns.

LEFT JOIN
The SQL LEFT JOIN joins two tables based on a common column, and selects records that have matching values in these columns and remaining rows from the left table.

RIGHT JOIN
The SQL RIGHT JOIN joins two tables based on a common column, and selects records that have matching values in these columns and remaining rows from the right table.

FULL OUTER JOIN
The SQL FULL OUTER JOIN joins two tables based on a common column, and selects records that have matching values in these columns and remaining rows from both of the tables.


5.how do we use the Distinct statement?what are its use?

SQL DISTINCT clause is used to remove the duplicates columns from the result set.
SELECT DISTINCT expressions  
FROM tables  
[WHERE conditions];  

uses

The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values. 
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; 
and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
